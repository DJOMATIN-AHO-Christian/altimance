# Note: altimance is a Node.js/Express backend application.
# Netlify is primarily for static sites and serverless functions.
# This configuration deploys the project but the Express server
# will NOT run on Netlify. Consider using Railway, Render, or Heroku
# for full backend deployment.
#
# If you have a static frontend, point 'publish' to that directory instead.
